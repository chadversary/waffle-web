Waffle 1.4.0-rc1 is now released and available for testing. This is
a testing preview of the upcoming 1.4.0 feature release.

It's been a loooooong time since the last release (Waffle 1.3.0 happened
in 2013!) and a lot has happened since then. Waffle now has a wflinfo
utility, supports Linux DRM render nodes through the GBM backend, is
packaged by several distributions, and has a proper issue tracker on
Github.  The most prominent change, in my opinion, as that Waffle has
more active contributors than last year (namely Jordan and Emil).

Since I've been out of practice of making releases, the release candidate will
cautiously bake for a full week before the final release.  If all goes
smoothly, I plan to publish the final 1.4.0 tarballs on Monday 15 September.

The next major release (2.0) will likely happen near the end of
September this month.  Emil has been working hard to add Windows support
to Waffle and Piglit, and that needs to be packaged up and shipped soon.

Waffle 1.4.0 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Backwards compatibility notes
- -----------------------------
Waffle 1.4.0 is backwards-compatible with Waffle 1.3.0, in ABI and API.


New Features
- ------------
* All platforms

    * wflinfo

      The new 'wflinfo' utility reports information about the system's OpenGL
      capabilities, similar to 'glxinfo'.  See the documentation at
      [man:wflinfo.1] or [http://www.waffle-gl.org/man/wflinfo.1.html].

      (Implemented by Jordan Justen. Chad Versace fixed some bugs and corner
      cases).

* Linux

    * GBM backend gains support for DRM render nodes.

      Waffle's GBM backend will now use render nodes (/dev/dri/render*) if
      available. Otherwise, it falls back to 1.3.0 behavior and will use a DRI
      card device (/dev/dri/card*). Render nodes require a recent kernel; you
      may need to add drm.rnodes=1 to the kernel cmdline.

      (Implemented by Jordan Justen).

    * Debian packaging support.

      Waffle now contains a toplevel 'debian' directory that supports creation
      of Debian packages.  Waffle packages are already available in Debian
      Unstable ("sid") as 'libwaffle-1.0', 'libwaffle-dev', 'libwaffle-doc',
      and 'waffle-utils'.

      (Debian packages are maintained by Jordan Justen).
