Waffle 1.5.2 Release Notes
==========================

Fixes since 1.5.1
-----------------

* Linux, all platforms
    * Fix dlopen'ing the GLES libararies. Don't rely on libGLES*.so symlinks at
      runtime. Instead, pass the full SONAME (libGLES*.so.${N}) to dlopen. (See
      5c2c7e8).

    * waffle_init() now returns false if it fails to dlopen libEGL or fails to
      dlsym any required symbol from libEGL. (See 2195f3e).

    * wflinfo: Fix glGetStringi usage on ARM Mali drivers. (See 9dc5555).

* GBM
    * Fix alpha channel in GBM format, fixing Piglit on some drivers. Waffle
      always chose a GBM format without alpha even the EGLConfig contained an
      alpha channel. (See 2bb9390).

* Windows
    * Fix some compilation errors. (See 9a33a3d).

    * Fix glGetStringi() usage. (See 9dc5555).

* Android
      * Don't export private symbols. Waffle neglected to add
        -fvisibility=hidden to the compiler flags. (See caf8001).

      * Fix building with clang. (See fc58a6f).

      * Add wflinfo and the gl_basic demo to the build. (See ad1b0c8).

* Apple
    * Don't emit unexpected errors from waffle_display_supports_context_api()
      when the system lacks the library for the queried API. (See 475b44f).

* Misc
    * gl_basic: Choose an EGLConfig with an alpha plane. gl_basic depended on
      the presence of an alpha plane despite neglecting to request it. (See
      76df03e).



Features since 1.5.1
--------------------

All new features introduced in minor releases are *minor* and introduce no
instability.

* gbm: Allow user to provide default device path in environment

  If waffle_display_connect() is passed name=NULL, then Waffle's GBM backend will
  now open the device path defined by environment variable WAFFLE_GBM_DEVICE. If
  WAFFLE_GBM_DEVICE is unset, then Waffle's behavior remains as before: it uses
  udev to search for a sensible DRM device node. (See 8d20f3a).
